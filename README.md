# Protein_Family_Classification

This project involved building a machine learning pipeline to classify protein sequences into different family IDs, achieving an impressive accuracy of 0.99855. The model leverages a deep learning approach using a 1D convolutional neural network (CNN) built with Keras. The data preprocessing pipeline includes tokenizing protein sequences at the character level, padding the sequences to a consistent length, and encoding labels using a LabelEncoder to convert family IDs into numeric values. The model architecture consists of an embedding layer to represent sequences as dense vectors, followed by a 1D convolutional layer, global max pooling, and several fully connected layers with dropout for regularization. The model was trained with the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss, with early stopping and model checkpointing used to prevent overfitting.

During training, both the accuracy and loss were monitored, and performance was evaluated on the validation set, where predictions were compared to true labels to compute the validation accuracy. Additionally, the modelâ€™s learned embeddings were visualized using UMAP and t-SNE, which helped gain insights into the separation of protein families in the embedding space. The final model, after training, was used to predict family IDs for the test set, and the results were saved in a submission file. This project demonstrates the effectiveness of using convolutional neural networks and modern data preprocessing techniques for sequence classification tasks, achieving strong performance in classifying protein sequences based on family IDs.
